# About the Project

The goal of this project is to construct a model to accurately predict annual income for listings on Airbnb.com. Annual income was modeled as a function of average nightly price, availability throughout the year, and occupancy rate. Several models were fit (OLS, LASSO, Random Forest, GBM) for prediction and inference. The [research report](Writeup.pdf) discusses the project in more detail, from EDA to data preprocessing to model fitting to conclusions. This project was done in collaboration with Yiheng He, Yizhang Lin, and Ziwei Liu at UC Berkeley.
